Minimum Viable product finished at 3PM. 

Features to add before 8PM:

Implement Dark mode: High Priority 
  Completed 5pm. Bug: Medium, can't change input color due to styles conflicts from                       borrowed code

                 Bug: Low, can't change colors to specific colors I wanted because of style conflicts (Material UI is picky sometimes)

Be more responsive: Medium Priority
  would require a bit of refactoring the styling and component generation, I did a bit so the elements wouldn't shrink to much. I don't like the wrap, the objects should be more dynamic, but don't have the time.

Implement Routes feature url/zip should automatically do what button press should: Medium priority
    This would be fun, as well, dynamic front side routing is something I have only done once

Front side route for search: Medium priority:
    Should be easy, might start messing with that now

Clean up styling in code to be more consistent: Low priority
  This would require a big refactor of the styling, I need more UX practice with Material so a good side project.
